# Lab 1 OOP (encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism)

## Task:
 >Create model of basic paint app by adding figure class hierarchy
 
## [Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming): 
### What is inheritance?

>Languages that support classes almost always support inheritance. This allows classes to be arranged in a hierarchy that represents "is-a-type-of" relationships. For example, class Employee might inherit from class Person. All the data and methods available to the parent class also appear in the child class with the same names. For example, class Person might define variables "first_name" and "last_name" with method "make_full_name()". These will also be available in class Employee, which might add the variables "position" and "salary". This technique allows easy re-use of the same procedures and data definitions, in addition to potentially mirroring real-world relationships in an intuitive way. Rather than utilizing database tables and programming subroutines, the developer utilizes objects the user may be more familiar with: objects from their application domain.


### What is [encapsulation](https://stackify.com/oop-concept-for-beginners-what-is-encapsulation/)?

>Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). Let’s examine how it’s done and unwrap some examples for this concept. By definition, encapsulation describes the idea of bundling data and methods that work on that data within one unit, like a class in Java. This concept is also often used to hide the internal representation, or state of an object from the outside. This is called information hiding. The general idea of this mechanism is simple. For example, you have an attribute that is not visible from the outside of an object. You bundle it with methods that provide read or write access. Encapsulation allows you to hide specific information and control access to the internal state of the object.

### What is polymorphism

>Subtyping – a form of polymorphism – is when calling code can be agnostic as to which class in the supported hierarchy it is operating on – the parent class or one of its descendants. Meanwhile, the same operation name among objects in an inheritance hierarchy may behave differently. For example, objects of type Circle and Square are derived from a common class called Shape. The Draw function for each type of Shape implements what is necessary to draw itself while calling code can remain indifferent to the particular type of Shape being drawn. This is another type of abstraction that simplifies code external to the class hierarchy and enables strong separation of concerns.
